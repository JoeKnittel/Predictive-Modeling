# Python
## Predictive Modelling Using NLP

This project was completed as an assignment for a graduate-level computer science course in natural language processing (CS 2731) at the University of Pittsburgh. 

The program takes a document as input and outputs the most likely language in which it was written, based on the document's composition (see image below).

A special type of markov model called an [n-gram model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) is used to perform this task.

### Contained in this repository: 

- code written in python
- training data for the model 
- a report (typeset using LaTeX) that goes further into depth regarding the nature of this project
