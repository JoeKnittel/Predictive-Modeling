# Python
## Predictive Modeling Using NLP

*This project was completed as an assignment for a graduate-level computer science course in Natural Language Processing (CS 2731) at the University of Pittsburgh.* 

**The program takes a document as input and outputs the most likely language in which it was written, based on the document's atomic structure.** 

A special type of [markov model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) called an [n-gram model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) is used to perform this task. Interestingly, [MLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation), an underlying concept frequently utilized in actuarial science, provides the basis for the model.

Below is an image depicting the program's output after running with the test document as input:

The included report provides considerable additional information about the program: motivation for the model, how the model is implemented in Python, and how the program is used.
